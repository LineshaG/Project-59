        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p id="para">The story revolves around the adventures of<br> four pets: two cats, Honey and Bunny; a<br> dog, Zordaar; and a parrot, Popat, who <br>live in a cosy house, owned by Miss Katkar.<br> The pets always set off on fun<br> and crazy adventures together. While they<br> are usually sweet and well-mannered, the <br>pets also save their town from evil men<br> and thieves and help the good and poor people.<br> That is why my favourite cartoon is<br> Sab Jholmaal Hai.

        <br>
        <p> My favourite characters of this Cartoon are the<br> twin brothers Honey and Bunny. I love honey<br> because Honey very cute and sweet. Other<br> characters of the series called him Gadha<br> (donkey). He also becomes angry when someone <br>beats his brother or friend. And I love <br>Bunny because he is very smart and he loves <br>to team up and play pranks on everyone <br>else. He is also protective of his friends.<br> Bunny is the smarter cat, and he plays<br> the main role to save others. </p>

        <a id ="inspiration" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Bunny_Ka_Jholmaal" target="_blank"> I am inspired by the pets who always set off on fun and crazy adventures bravely together.They are usually sweet and well-mannered, the pets also save their town from evil men and thieves and help the good and poor people. So I learned that we should be sweet and well-mannered like them and save everyone in need like them. </a>
